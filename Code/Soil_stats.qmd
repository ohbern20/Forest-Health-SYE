```{r}
rm(list = ls()) 
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

Soil <- read.csv(here("Data", "Cleaned", "EnviroVars2021.csv"))
```


Find mean and sd for the soil stats I'm including in my cor matrix 
```{r}
for_table <- Soil |>
  group_by(Forest) |>
  summarise(mean_SOM = mean(mSOM),
            sd_SOM = sd(mSOM),
            mean_Nitrate = mean(mNitrate),
            sd_Nitrate = sd(mNitrate),
            mean_pH = mean(m_pH),
            sd_pH = sd(m_pH),
            mean_CEC = mean(mCEC),
            sd_CEC = sd(mCEC))
```
